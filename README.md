# TASCD-APP
TASCD -> Tiempo A Solas Con Dios (Time alone with God)

## Introduction
It is an app that transforms the tascd tool to a virtual environment. 
This tool is very common among evangelical Christians as a way to connect with God and communicate with him through a daily devotional verse. 
It is important to clarify that this repository only has the APP or Front-End, The Back-End is here [TASCD-API](https://github.com/Avilezf/TASCD-API). This is a personal project that 
I have done with the help of God for the welfare of all, this repository will be open to anyone who wants to improve or make changes to it.

### TASCD Instructions
1. Prepare to hear from God.

2. Read and reflect on the word of God.

3. Pampe & Answer to God.

4. Take notes of the conversations.

the instructions are easy, with the acronyms PAMPE and EPA.
```
P -> Pecados: (Sins: Sins that I must confess?)
A -> Actitudes: (Acttitudes: Attitudes that I should adopt?)
M -> Mandamientos (Commandments: commandments that I must obey?)
P -> Promesas: (Promises: promises that I must claim?)

In a way

```
### Why do the TASCD?
This tool can be used by anyone, you don't need to be a genius or have a high spiritual relationship to be able to do it, 
even non-believers can understand the message God wants to convey through the verse. The most important thing is to understand this message, 
because through this God wants to speak to you and wants to help you so that you can always live a full and happy life.
